# Object detection and Classification models
Currently, an object detection model using yolo is deployed on flask app and a basic user interface front end is created using html-css. Further, in future, object classfication and detection models will be added and  the front end will be modified accordingly.  

## Execution steps:
* Create a virtual environment:  
  ```virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3 <name and path of new environment folder>```
* Activate the virtual environment:  
  ```source <name of environment>/bin/activate```
* Install all dependencies inside the virtual environment:

    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
* Run the server:  
  ```python3 server.py```
